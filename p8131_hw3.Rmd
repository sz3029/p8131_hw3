## Problem 1

### a) Fit a prospective model to the data to study the relation consumption, age, and disease. Interpret the result.

Model age as a continuous variable taking values 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, and 75

```{r input, echo=FALSE}
data1 = tibble(age = c(25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75), case_0_79 = c(0, 5, 21, 34, 36, 8), 
               case_80 = c(1, 4, 25, 42, 19, 5), control_0_79 = c(106, 164, 138, 139, 88, 31),
               control_80 = c(9, 26, 29, 27, 18, 0))
data1
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
